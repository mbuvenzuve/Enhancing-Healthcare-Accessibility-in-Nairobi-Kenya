## Introduction
This repository contains the code and datasets used in a data analysis project aimed at improving healthcare accessibility in Nairobi County, Kenya. The project leverages data-driven insights to align local efforts with the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) - ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all.

## Business Understanding
In Nairobi County, achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) faces hurdles due to challenges in healthcare accessibility and demographic disparities. To address these issues effectively, stakeholders must comprehend the complex dynamics among healthcare infrastructure, population demographics, and socio-economic factors. Healthcare accessibility is unevenly distributed across the county, while demographic differences in population density, age, and socio-economic status exacerbate the situation. A comprehensive approach is needed, leveraging data-driven insights to inform policies, interventions, and resource allocation. Collaboration among various stakeholders is crucial for developing tailored solutions that account for local contexts and realities. By addressing these challenges holistically, Nairobi County can make significant progress towards ensuring the health and well-being of its population in line with SDG 3.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to tackle several key challenges in Nairobi County's healthcare system. Firstly, it seeks to identify gaps and opportunities to enhance healthcare access and reduce disparities across the region. This involves analyzing healthcare data to gain insights into the distribution of healthcare facilities, population demographics, and birth trends. By understanding where healthcare facilities are located, the demographics of the population they serve, and trends in birth rates, stakeholders can identify areas with limited access to healthcare services and prioritize interventions accordingly. Additionally, the project aims to develop data-driven insights that can guide stakeholders in designing targeted interventions to improve healthcare accessibility. These insights will be instrumental in informing policy decisions, resource allocation, and the implementation of initiatives aimed at addressing healthcare disparities and promoting equitable access to quality healthcare services throughout Nairobi County.

## Key Objectives
* Analyze the distribution of healthcare facilities across different sub-locations in Nairobi County.
* Evaluate the relationship between population density and the number of healthcare facilities available.
* Assess the proportion of births occurring in healthcare facilities to gauge utilization rates.
* Identify disparities in healthcare access based on demographic and socio-economic factors.
* Provide recommendations for improving healthcare accessibility and advancing SDG 3 objectives.
